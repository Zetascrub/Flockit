All notable changes to the **Flockit** will be documented in this file.

---

- Severity tagging and markdown colourisation in AI output.
- Potential project name change
- Move checks to the start of the script (Ollama, Nmap, etc)
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

## [0.6.3]

### Added
- Full **Passive Recon** support:
  - WHOIS and DNS record collection (A, MX, NS, TXT) for external/web targets.
  - Results are integrated into the report under each host as `"passive"`.
- **AI Plugin Autogeneration**:
  - If no plugin exists for a port/service, Flock-It generates one using Ollama or OpenAI.
  - Generated plugins validated for required methods (`should_run`, `run`) and stored under `modules/plugins`.
- New `--auto-plugin` flag and enhanced `--auto` logic now cover plugin gen, AI analysis, and upload.
- XML Settings schema expanded to include:
  - `<DefaultAIProvider>`, `<OpenAI>`, and additional SMB/server options.
- `Magpie` plugin manager with validation, dynamic loading, and plugin coverage checks.
- Auto-report viewer prompt with fallback to OS default viewer.

### Improved
- Final result filtering in `flockit.py` now ensures only complete and valid hosts remain.
- Project flow now logically runs: pre-checks → reachability → scan → AI analysis → report → optional upload.
- `Owl` report module now adds artifact links per port (e.g. banners, plugin outputs).
- Executive summary at report end dynamically summarizes key exposures and suggestions.
- Settings loading and application is now global and consistent across all modules.

### Fixed
- Prevented malformed or incomplete data from breaking the AI or report generation phases.
- Improved plugin code sanitisation to remove duplicate or invalid import statements.
- Plugin filename conflicts avoided by auto-slugging service/port combos.

## [0.6.3]

### Added
- **Plugin Auto-Generation**:
  - Magpie now uses Ollama to generate new plugins for uncovered services automatically.
  - Generated plugins inherit from `ScanPlugin` and include `should_run()` and `run()` methods.
  - Plugins are validated before being saved and reloaded dynamically.

- **Mode-Aware AUTO Flags**:
  - Refined `AUTO` config handling with more granular usage for automation (e.g., report viewing, plugin generation).

- **Improved AI Analysis**:
  - AI summaries are now inserted per host with better markdown formatting.
  - Fallback messages are included when analysis fails.

### Improved
- `Raven` now uses **multi-threaded scanning** via `ThreadPoolExecutor` for faster parallel port scanning across hosts.
- `Owl` generates richer markdown reports by including:
  - Plugin output blocks
  - Executive summaries
  - SSL scan and AI results per host

- Cross-platform compatibility improved when opening generated reports.

### Fixed
- Plugins generated by Magpie now reload immediately after generation, avoiding missed detections.
- `AUTO` dictionary use standardized to ensure correct behavior in all user prompts.
- Report generation now gracefully handles malformed scan results or missing data.

## [0.6.2]

### Improved
- Replaced standard logging output in the terminal with `print_status()` for cleaner, user-friendly output.
  - Status levels use emojis and colors (e.g., ✅ success, ⚠️ warning, ❌ error).
  - Automatically logs to file while showing clean output in terminal.
- Added `print_banner()` to mark major script phases with styled headings.
- Suppressed duplicate console output by removing the `StreamHandler` from the logger setup.
- Streamlined messaging logic across internal modules (`PreFlightCheck`, `util.py`).
- Migrated settings to `settings.xml` for dynamic configuration (ports, timeout, SMB info, valid IP ranges).
- Modularised the codebase into themed components:
  - `PreFlight` (scope parsing, setup, SMB upload)
  - `RavenRecon` (active scanning with plugins)
  - `Owl` (markdown reporting & AI analysis)
- Plugins are now standalone files and can inherit from a base `ScanPlugin`.
- Plugin scanning now uses consistent output format and integrates with `raven.results`.

### Fixed
- Resolved terminal output duplication caused by combined logger and print calls.
- Fixed indentation and `cprint` argument bugs within the enhanced `print_status()` function.
- Corrected `getpass` usage to avoid `TypeError: 'module' object is not callable`.
- Plugins now load independently using safe dynamic import handling.
- Fixed `KeyError` on `nmap` scan results when hosts return no data.
- Prevented `UnboundLocalError` when skipping active recon or AI analysis.

### Added
- Full rewrite of `README.md` to reflect new modular structure.
- Added `demo.gif` terminal preview support.
- Introduced `Why Flockit?` section to explain the naming and vision behind the tool.
